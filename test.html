        <p>Hello Everyone!
            My name is Elizabeth Wilhite. Most people call me Liz. I am currently working on my Bachelors Degree in
            Professional Studies with majors in Family History Research and Computer Web Fundamentals.</p>

        <p> I love to do many things. I like reading, playing music, crochet, bead work, painting, video games, watching
            videos, and many other things. I like to circulate through these hobbies so that I feel like I am really
            relaxing with something new.</p>

        <p>I am married, with one toddler. We celebrated our fifth year of marriage just this year. We live in the
            northern Utah area between North Salt Lake and Ogden. I apologize that I can't be more specific as we take
            care of children who need protection. </p>

        <p>I know that learning more about computers in any capacity will help me with my famiy history research. I feel
            like computers and genealogy are almost inseperable. At least that is where the future seems to be headed.
        </p>

        <p> I look forward to working with all of you throughout this semester! </p>
